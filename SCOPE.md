# Project Scope

The Pinniped project is guided by the following principles.

- Pinniped lets you plug any external identity providers into Kubernetes.
  These integrations follow enterprise-grade security principles.
- Pinniped is easy to install and use on any Kubernetes cluster via distribution-specific integration mechanisms.
- Pinniped uses a declarative configuration via Kubernetes APIs.
- Pinniped provides optimal user experience when authenticating to many clusters at one time.
- Pinniped provides enterprise-grade security posture via secure defaults and revocable or very short-lived credentials.
- Where possible, Pinniped will contribute ideas and code to upstream Kubernetes.

When contributing to Pinniped, please consider whether your contribution follows
these guiding principles.
